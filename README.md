# polkadot-sdk-workshop-xcm
 Workshop for learning about Polkadot SDK's XCM

## Scenarios

This workshop will not be comprehensive to all possible interactions, but will focus on a few key scenarios that we commonly expect to see in the Polkadot Ecosystem.

As a parachain:

1. Accepting and using the native asset of your relay chain.
2. Accepting and using the native asset of other parachains.
3. Accessing pallets of the relay chain or other parachains.
